Python Basics

This repository contains a collection of Python programs and practice scripts I’ve written while learning Python as part of my Computer Science and Data Science journey.

It includes implementations of core Python concepts, basic data handling, and small exercises with standard libraries.

Contents

1. Core Concepts
- Variables and Expressions
- Conditionals and Loops
- Functions and Arguments (including *args and **kwargs)
- File Handling and Exception Handling
- Classes, Inheritance, Method Overriding, and Polymorphism

2. Data Structures and Programming Patterns
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
- List Comprehension
- Generators and Decorators

3. Python Libraries Practice
- NumPy basics
- Matplotlib basics (graphplot.py)
- GUI (calendar GUI using Tkinter)

Goals with This Repository

- Practice Python fundamentals and syntax
- Reinforce problem-solving and logic skills
- Build foundational knowledge for future Data Science and ML work
- Keep track of what I’ve learned over time

Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3.10+
- Editor: VS Code
- Tools: Git, GitHub
- Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, tkinter (standard GUI)
